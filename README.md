HTML is the backbone of a website. It provides the structure and content of a webpage by using a system of tags and elements. HTML tags define different parts of a web page, such as headings, paragraphs, links, images, and forms. For example:

<h1> - defines a top-level heading.

<p> - defines a paragraph.

<a> - defines a hyperlink.

<img> - embeds an image.

HTML also allows for the creation of more complex elements like tables, lists, and multimedia content, making it the essential tool for structuring content on the web.

CSS: The Style

While HTML defines the structure, CSS controls the appearance and layout of a webpage. CSS is used to specify things like colors, fonts, spacing, and positioning. With CSS, you can:

Set text styles (font-size, color, etc.).

Define the layout of elements (e.g., positioning, alignment, grids).

Control the responsiveness (ensuring a webpage looks good on devices of all sizes).

Add visual effects (e.g., hover effects, transitions, and animations).

CSS allows for great flexibility, with the ability to separate content (HTML) from its presentation (CSS), making it easier to maintain and style websites.

Together, HTML and CSS work in harmony to create well-structured, visually appealing, and user-friendly web pages.
